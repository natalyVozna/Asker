        We were recently introduced to BizPay and offered their payment option to a small number of clients as a test. It proved to be quick, simple and popular with our clients, so we quickly rolled
        it out and offered BizPay on all our invoices to all our clients.
        <br/>
        BizPay has also helped eliminate the problem of collections from a difficult client. I&apos;ve recommended other agencies to BizPay
        and don&apos;t see why anyone wouldn&apos;t offer it to their clients — lots of benefits and no downside.

  //       I usually ignore any services offering cash flow solutions. Still, somehow BizPay got my attention and delivered what they promised, and it has been an absolute delight to work together with the
  //       BizPay team.

        BizPay has enabled us to improve our cash flow cycle significantly, which means we can grow faster than we were previously able to do. Their rates are less than half the competitors we had been dealing with prior to working with them. The system is seamless; it&apos;s very easy to use for both us, our suppliers, and the turnaround times are very quick.
        <br/>
        From Day 1, our BizPay Account Executive, has been a huge support. He was able to walk us through how the platform works and has personally called a number of our suppliers to walk them through the process and give them comfort. The whole BizPay team has gone above and beyond for us to ensure our suppliers are paid quickly. I would highly recommend BizPay to any business looking to improve their cash flow cycle to facilitate growth.

  //       We have been working with BizPay now for approximately 1.5 years and during this time we have seen how much BizPay has grown as a company whilst staying true to their core values. BizPay has supported our business through an important part of our growth stage and right from the very start we were blown away by the strong values held by BizPay.
  //       <br/>
  //       The entire team have gone above and beyond to ensure every interaction is at the highest standard. They are contactable around the clock and process payments within lighting fast time frames sometimes within half an hour to an hour, something of which you don't find with their competitors. I encourage anyone reading this review to really consider BizPay to support your business growth. They have a very strong business model and in my opinion they are the best within the market. We look forward to working with BizPay for many years to come.

        We are a mining, tunnelling and construction company based across Australia. BizPay has helped us pay our employees their wages on time and enabled us to take on contracts, which wouldn&apos;t have been possible without this service and support. We would certainly recommend BizPay to other businesses like ours.

        BizPay has been nothing but amazing. Lisa, our superstar account manager, has been so helpful and quick to respond! They really are on your team! David, the Global CEO, has been nothing but extremely helpful and understanding during these tough times.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        They genuinely want to help you out and do everything in their power to do so! Highly recommended and will ALWAYS be my first go-to for quick funding.

        As a start-up business we learned very quickly how the processing period of invoices in our industry can place a lot of stress on a young business like ours. BizPay’s unique yet affordable solution has been instrumental in the slow but steady cash flow for our business.
        <br/>
        We are in no way obligated to use BizPay on a regular basis as this is allowed us by the conditions that govern the service BizPay offers. I love that about the way BizPay offers their service as it allows a young business like ours the flexibility to only utilise their services when we require it. David and his team are very professional and are very understanding and for that I cannot thank them enough. Thus, I highly recommend BizPay to anyone who is in search of a financial solution for your business.
